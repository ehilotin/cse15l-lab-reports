In the second half of the quarter, I was most interested by learning how to create bash scripts. I didn't know anything about scripting before this class, and now I think that scripting is a really efficient (and sometimes even fun) way to run programs. Learning about bash scripting really opened my eyes to a new world of possibilities in which I wouldn't have to type tons of commands just to achieve the same result as one script. Scripting will probably be my biggest takeaway from the second half of this class.
