> Hi. I’m not sure why this test is failing. It seems like maybe a loop is running too many times? But when I look at my code, I’m not sure what’s wrong with it.

## A TA's (Possible) Response
**ta123:**
> Hi there! You’re on the right track with your guess, but can you think of any tools we’ve used in class that can help you figure out where your program has unexpected behavior?

# Part 2 - Reflection
In the second half of the quarter, I was most interested by learning how to create bash scripts. I didn't know anything about scripting before this class, and now I think that scripting is a really efficient (and sometimes even fun) way to run programs. Learning about bash scripting really opened my eyes to a new world of possibilities in which I wouldn't have to type tons of commands just to achieve the same result as one script. Scripting will probably be my biggest takeaway from the second half of this class.
